## 🎯 Completed Tasks

### 1. Hot Topic Agent Development
- Enhanced existing Hot Topic Agent with RSS collection capabilities
- Created RSS collector module (`rss_collector.py`) that integrates with multiple news sources (36kr, Huxiu, InfoQ, The Verge, TechCrunch)
- Successfully ran hot topic collection - gathered 10-15 real-time hot news events

### 2. RSSHub Integration  
- Scraped RSSHub social media resources from https://rsshub.netlify.app/routes/social-media
- Identified 36+ RSS subscription sources across 14 platforms
- Created `rsshub_feeds.py` with comprehensive feed configurations
- Supported platforms: Bilibili, Weibo, Zhihu, YouTube, Twitter, Douban, Telegram, Instagram, Xiaohongshu, Douyin, Jike, Jianshu, Coolapk, Tencent

### 3. Knowledge Graph Embedding Module
- Created two versions of KG embedding module:
  - `knowledge_embedding.py` (16KB) - Full version with PyTorch support
  - `knowledge_embedding_light.py` (14KB) - Lightweight version (no numpy dependencies)
- Core features implemented:
  - Entity embedding (64-dimensional vectors)
  - Semantic similarity calculation (cosine similarity)
  - Link prediction
  - Event clustering (K-Means)
  - Relationship modeling

### 4. Enhanced Hot Topic Agent
- Created `enhanced_hot_agent.py` that integrates knowledge graph embedding
- Generates enhanced knowledge graphs with embedding analysis
- Features:
  - Automatic event collection
  - Enhanced knowledge graph building with 3 layers (events, phenomena, psychology)
  - Embedding-based similarity analysis
  - Automatic event clustering
  - Link prediction
  - Mermaid visualization export

### 5. GitHub Resource Research
- Searched for knowledge graph related GitHub projects without API
- Found 3,108+ knowledge graph repositories
- Identified top projects like PyKEEN, NetworkX, PyVis, Neo4j
- Created resource document: `skills/hot-agent/references/knowledge-graph-github-resources.md`

### 6. Agent Behavior Rules
- Added important rule: "No GitHub push without explicit user command"
- Added GitHub push safety check rules
- All rules stored in `memory/agent-behavior-rules.md`

### 7. Complete Knowledge Graph Report
- Generated comprehensive knowledge graph report
- File: `output/FINAL_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_REPORT.md`
- Includes 8 hot events, 4 phenomena, 4 psychology states
- Mermaid visualization
- Semantic analysis results
- Cluster analysis findings
- Actionable insights

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **RSS Integration**: Successfully integrated RSSHub feeds for hot topic collection without requiring API keys
2. **Knowledge Graph Embedding**: Created lightweight embedding system that works without heavy ML dependencies
3. **Semantic Analysis**: Implemented cosine similarity and clustering for event analysis
4. **Agent Enhancement**: Integrated embedding analysis into main Hot Topic Agent workflow
5. **User Preferences**: User prefers no automatic GitHub pushes - requires explicit commands

## 🔄 Workflow Improvements

### Before
- Basic hot topic collection
- Simple knowledge graph generation
- Manual analysis required

### After  
- Integrated RSS collection (15+ news sources)
- Knowledge graph embedding with semantic analysis
- Automatic clustering and link prediction
- Enhanced Mermaid visualization
- Comprehensive analysis reports

## 📝 Notes

- Knowledge Graph Embedding module (`knowledge_embedding_light.py`) works without numpy dependencies
- Enhanced Hot Topic Agent successfully generates knowledge graphs with embedding analysis
- RSSHub integration provides real-time hot topic data
- User emphasizes transparency and explicit permissions for operations
